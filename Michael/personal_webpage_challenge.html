<H2>Why I chose Tech</H2>
<p>Tech for me started off as a hobby as a child but increasingly became more and more important to my day to day life. I yeanred to know how thing worked; how all of the pieces came together to produce these machine and the content I saw on the screen. To me, This posed everlasting curiosity. A feeling that would remain till this day.</p>
