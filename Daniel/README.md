customized README.md inside my personal folder as part of challenge 3 given 9/13/21
I am now adding 2 - 3 more lines to this file as Yusuf asked last week on the 9/15/21.
After I make the additions I will save them.
I will push changes.
I will create a pull request with Yusuf as my reviwer.
He will then decide to merge on main or not.
