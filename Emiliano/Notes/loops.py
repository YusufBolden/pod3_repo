# for x in y
# for (each) person in (the list of) people
# y = list of people
# x = each person

# for (each object) in the list of stocks

# for (each stock) in the list of stocks

# for (each random thing) in hte list of random lthings

# numbers = [12, 8, 41]

# for number in numbers:
#     #stand in variable
#     pprint(number)
#     #any code inside the loop is printed each time. Compare hello world and hi computer. 
#     pprint("Hello World!")

# pprint("hi, computer")

#loops can contain different operations. 

# lower_list = ['here', 'are', 'my','lower', 'case', 'words']
# upper_list =[]

# for i in lower_list:
#     upper_list.append(i.upper())
#     pprint(upper_list)

# Three techniques for coding loops
# 1)for loops -- for each item in a proup of items:
# do something with that item

# ##laundry_basket = ['sweater', 'tank top','jeans', 'dress shirt']

#for each garmet in our laundry basket:
#   fold the garmet
#   put away the garmet
# reward! eat chocolate 

# ##for garmet in laundry_basket:
#  if garmet == 'jeans':
#         print(f'Check if {garmet} is dry')
#         print(garmet)
#         print('Fold the', garmet)
#         print('Put away the', garmet)
# print("you get a chocolate!")




# 2) For loops with the range function for each number in a range of numbers;
#do something with that number

correct_password = 'password_123'
password =''
if password == correct_password:



# 3) While loops are based on a condition. 
# while a condition si true, keep going. 
# psuedo code is talking out the code. eg. Step 1: see how many people split the bill

while password != correct_password:
    password =input ('Pleae enter your password: ')
